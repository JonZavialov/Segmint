# Segmint
Segmint comes from ***segment***.

Modern Git workflows operate on raw diffs and files. Segmint works at a higher level — it segments changes by intent.

Instead of treating a repository as lines of text, Segmint models it as structured changesets that AI agents can reason about: related edits are grouped together, commits become semantic units, and pull requests reflect actual engineering decisions.

Segmint exists to bridge that gap — turning diffs into meaning, and meaning into clean version history.
